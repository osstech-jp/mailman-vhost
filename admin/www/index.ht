<h3>Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager</h3>

Mailman is free software for managing electronic mail discussion and
e-newsletter lists.  Mailman is integrated with the web, making it
easy for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to
administer their lists.  Mailman supports built-in archiving,
automatic bounce processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam
filters, and more.  See the <a href="features.html">features page</a>
for details.

<p>Mailman is free software, distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.  Mailman is written in the
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language, with a little bit of C code for security.

<p>The name of this software is spelled <em>Mailman</em>
with a capital leading <em>M</em> and a lowercase second <em>m</em>.
It is incorrect to spell it "MailMan" (i.e. you should not use
StudlyCaps).
