3.7.2 Sender filters</A>
</H3>

<P>
When a message is posted to the list, a series of moderation criteria are
applied to determine the disposition of the message.  This section
contains the modeation controls for postings from both members and
non-members.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>default_member_moderation</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Member postings are held for moderation if their <i>moderation
    flag</i> is turned on.  Note that only the list administrators can
    change the value of a member's moderation flag.

<P>
You can control whether new members get their moderation flag
    turned on or off by default when they subscribe to the list.  By
    turning this flag off by default, postings by members will be
    allowed without further intervention (barring other restrictions
    such as size or implicit recipient lists - see below).  By
    turning the flag on, you can quarantine new member postings to
    make sure that they meet your criteria for netiquette, topicality,
    etc.  Once you determine that the new member understands the
    community's posting rules, you can turn off their moderation flag
    and let their postings go through unstopped.

<P>
E-newsletter style lists can also be set up by using the
    moderation flag.  By setting the <code>member_moderation_action</code>
    to <i>Reject</i>, and by turning off the moderation flag for just
    the few approved senders, your list will operate in essentially a
    one-way direction.  Note that you'd also need to reject or discard
    postings from non-members.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>member_moderation_action</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the action to take for postings from a member who's
    moderation flag is set.  For typical discussion lists, you'll
    likely set this to <i>Hold</i> so that the list moderator will get
    a chance to manually approve, reject, or discard the message.  For
    e-newsletter and announcement lists, you might want to set this to
    <i>Reject</i> or <i>Discard</i>.

<P>
Note that when a moderated member posts to your list, and the
    <code>member_moderation_action</code> is set to <i>Hold</i>, the message
    will appear on the administrative requests page.  When you dispose
    of the message, you will be given an opportunity to clear the
    moderation flag at the same time.   If you're quarantining new
    posts, this makes it very convenient to both approve a new
    member's post and de-moderate them at the same time.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>member_moderation_notice</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a member's moderation flag is turned on and
    <code>member_moderation_action</code> is <i>Reject</i>, this variable
    contains the text sent in the rejection notice.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The next batch of variables controls what happens when non-members
post messages to the list.  Each of these accepts one email address
per line; regular expressions are allowed if the line starts with the
(caret) character.  These address lists are always consulted in the
order in which they're presented on this page (i.e. accepts first,
followed by holds, rejections, and discards).

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>accept_these_nonmembers</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Postings from non-members whose addresses match this list are
    accepted, barring other list restrictions due to size, implicit
    recipients, etc.  You might want to add alternative addresses of
    approved posters to this list.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>hold_these_nonmembers</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Postings from non-members whose addresses match this list are
    held for moderator approval.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>reject_these_nonmembers</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Postings from non-members whose addresses match this list are
    rejected, i.e. bounced back to the original sender.  There
    currently is no way to add additional text to the rejection
    message.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>discard_these_nonmembers</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Postings from non-members whose addresses match this list are
    discarded, with no bounce back message.  You might want to add the
    addresses of known spammers to this list.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>generic_nonmember_action</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This variable controls what happens to non-member posts when the
    address of the sender doesn't match any of the above four lists.
    If you set this to <i>Hold</i>, the posting will appear on the
    administrative requests page, and you will be given an opportunity
    to add the non-member to one of the above four lists at the same
    time you dispose of the held message.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>forward_auto_discards</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When messages from non-members are discarded, either because the
    sender address matched <code>discard_these_nonmembers</code>, or because
    <code>generic_nonmember_action</code> is <i>Discard</i>, you can choose
    whether such messages are forwarded to the lsit administrators or
    not.
</DD>
