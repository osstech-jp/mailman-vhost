The mailman-config.py script simply displays a few build-time option choices, 
along with the option string provided to the configure script on the command 
line. The latter is convenient when updating to a new version of Mailman 2, or 
when trying to synchronize a manual Mailman installation with a the FHS of a 
distribution.

Currently the script requires python 2.x.
