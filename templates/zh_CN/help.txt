Help for %(listname)s mailing list:

This is email command help for version %(version)s of the "Mailman"
list manager.  The following describes commands you can send to get
information about and control your subscription to Mailman lists at
this site.  A command can be in the subject line or in the body of the
message.

Note that much of the following can also be accomplished via the World
Wide Web, at:

    %(listinfo_url)s

In particular, you can use the Web site to have your password sent to
your delivery address.

List specific commands (subscribe, who, etc) should be sent to the
*-request address for the particular list, e.g. for the 'mailman'
list, use 'mailman-request@...'.

About the descriptions - words in "<>"s signify REQUIRED items and
words in "[]" denote OPTIONAL items.  Do not include the "<>"s or
"[]"s when you use the commands.

The following commands are valid:

    subscribe [password] [digest-option] [address=<address>]
        Subscribe to the mailing list.  Your password must be given to
        unsubscribe or change your options.  When you subscribe to the
        list, you'll be reminded of your password periodically.
        'digest-option' may be either: 'nodigest' or 'digest' (no
        quotes!)  If you wish to subscribe an address other than the
        address you send this request from, you may specify
        "address=<email address>" (no brackets around the email
        address, no quotes!)

    unsubscribe <password> [address]
        Unsubscribe from the mailing list.  Your password must match
        the one you gave when you subscribed.  If you are trying to
        unsubscribe from a different address than the one you
        subscribed from, you may specify it in the 'address' field.

    help
        This message.

    set <option> <on|off> <password> 
        Turn on or off list options.  Valid options are:

        ack:
            Turn this on to receive acknowledgement mail when you send
            mail to the list.

        digest:
            Receive mail from the list bundled together instead of one
            post at a time.

        plain:
            Get plain-text, not MIME-compliant, digests (only if
            digest is set)

        nomail:
            Stop delivering mail.  Useful if you plan on taking a
            short vacation.

        norcv:
            Turn this on to NOT receive posts you send to the list.
            Does not work if digest is set.

        hide:
            Conceals your address when people look at who is on this
            list.


    options
        Show the current values of your list options.

    password <oldpassword> <newpassword> 
        Change your list password.
    
    end or --
       Stop processing commands (good to do if your mailer
       automatically adds a signature file - it'll save you from a lot
       of cruft).
